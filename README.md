# 🚀 Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) 🤯

Welcome to the **Quantum Chaos Zone**, where randomness isn't just a feature—it's the law of physics! 🌌✨ Brace yourself as we harness the spooky magic of quantum mechanics to create randomness that's so random, even your dice will be jealous. 🎲

## 💡 What’s This Wizardry?  
Imagine flipping a quantum coin that's both heads AND tails until you dare to look at it. 🪙 That's what our Quantum Random Number Generator does. It taps into the **multiverse of madness** (okay, just quantum superposition) to spit out numbers as unpredictable as the internet at 3 AM.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need:
- A computer (duh 🖥️)
- Python (to speak the language of the quantum gods 🐍)
- Qiskit (the magic wand for quantum spells 🪄)

---

## 📜 How to Use This Arcane Knowledge:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Quantum-Random-Number-Generator.git

Install the sacred tools:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the quantum ritual
python qrng.py

Be amazed as the quantum realm delivers a random number straight from the quantum soup. 🥣

🎉 Why Use This?
Because pseudo-random is for mortals. 🧑‍💻
With our QRNG, you get:

True randomness (quantum-certified chaos!).
Impress-your-friends level geekiness. 🤓
The satisfaction of knowing you're cooler than Schrödinger's cat. 😼
🤔 Questions?
Q: Is this overkill for generating a random number?
A: Absolutely. And that's the point. 💥

Q: Can I use this for cryptography?
A: Sure, but consult an expert first unless you want your secrets as exposed as a social media oversharer. 🔐

Q: Will this break reality?
A: Only a little. We’ll blame it on quantum entanglement. 😉
